## Schemas of netflix

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
( 
	show_id	VARCHAR(10),

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
-- Method 1
SELECT 
  type,
  COUNT(*) AS Cnt_of
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;

-- Method 2
SELECT 
  COUNT( DISTINCT CASE WHEN type = 'Movie' THEN show_id END ) AS Movie_Count,
  COUNT( DISTINCT CASE WHEN type = 'Tv Show' THEN show_id END ) AS TV_Show_Count
FROM netflix;
```

**Objective:** Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix.

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
  type,
  rating,
  Count_of_Rating
FROM
( SELECT 
    type,
    rating,
    COUNT(*) as Count_of_Rating,
    RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ) AS rnk
FROM netflix 
    GROUP BY 1, 2) AS temp_tbl
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020
      AND type = 'movie';
```

**Objective:** Retrieve all movies released in a specific year.

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE split_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        show_id,
        TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(country, ',', 1), ',', -1)) AS country,
        1 AS part,
        country AS full
    FROM netflix
    WHERE country IS NOT NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        show_id,
        TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(full, ',', part + 1), ',', -1)) AS country,
        part + 1,
        full
    FROM split_cte
    WHERE part < LENGTH(full) - LENGTH(REPLACE(full, ',', '')) + 1
)

SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM split_cte
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Objective:** Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
-- Method 1
SELECT 
  title,
  duration
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY CAST(LEFT( duration, locate(" ", duration, 1)-1) AS UNSIGNED) DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Method 2 

/*
Syntax

SUBSTRING_INDEX(str, delim, count)
üîß Parameters:
str: The full string you want to extract from.

delim: The delimiter to split on (e.g., ' ', ',', '-')

count:

If positive, returns the first count parts (from the left).

If negative, returns the last count parts (from the right).*/

/*Examples
Let‚Äôs say this is your string:

sql
'90 min'

1. Get the first word (before the space):

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('90 min', ' ', 1);
-- Result: '90'
2. Get the second word:

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('90 min', ' ', -1);
-- Result: 'min'
3. Get the first 2 parts (useful for 3-part strings):

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('United States, China, United Kingdom', ',', 2);
-- Result: 'United States, China'
4. Get the last 2 countries:

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('United States, China, United Kingdom', ',', -2);
-- Result: 'China, United Kingdom'*/

SELECT 
  title,

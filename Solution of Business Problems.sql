/*
Syntax

SUBSTRING_INDEX(str, delim, count)
ðŸ”§ Parameters:
str: The full string you want to extract from.

delim: The delimiter to split on (e.g., ' ', ',', '-')

count:

If positive, returns the first count parts (from the left).

If negative, returns the last count parts (from the right).*/

/*Examples
Letâ€™s say this is your string:

sql
'90 min'

1. Get the first word (before the space):

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('90 min', ' ', 1);
-- Result: '90'
2. Get the second word:

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('90 min', ' ', -1);
-- Result: 'min'
3. Get the first 2 parts (useful for 3-part strings):

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('United States, China, United Kingdom', ',', 2);
-- Result: 'United States, China'
4. Get the last 2 countries:

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('United States, China, United Kingdom', ',', -2);
-- Result: 'China, United Kingdom'*/
